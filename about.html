            I have a passion for computers, technology, and programming. I've
            recently finished studying a Bachelor's of Information and
            Communication Technology at the University of the Sunshine Coast and
            aspire to work as a software developer or programmer. <br>
            <br>

          <p class="tagline">
            I have always had a great passion
            and interest in problem-solving with a rich history in many
            strategy games like Chess and Poker. To me programming feels like a
            natural progression from these activities where you are given a
            problem and must use the resources you currently have to find the
            best possible solution. <br>
            <br>

          </p>
          <p class="tagline">
            I also have a strong desire for mental
            health, fitness, and sport. I'm a massive rugby league fan and
            played throughout high school in representative sides for Manly-Warringah.
